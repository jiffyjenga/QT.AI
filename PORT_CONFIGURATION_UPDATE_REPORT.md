# Port Configuration Update Report

## Overview
This report outlines the port configuration updates made to ensure compatibility with Windows 11 and to avoid port conflicts.

## Port Configuration

### Backend
- Default port: 8000
- Environment variable: BACKEND_PORT
- Configuration file: .env

### Frontend
- Default port: 3000
- Environment variable: FRONTEND_PORT
- Configuration file: .env

### API
- Default port: 8000
- Base path: /api
- Full URL: http://localhost:8000/api

## Port Conflict Resolution
To avoid port conflicts on Windows 11, the following measures have been implemented:

1. **Dynamic Port Assignment**
   - The application now supports dynamic port assignment through environment variables
   - If the default ports are in use, the application will attempt to use alternative ports

2. **Port Conflict Detection**
   - The application now detects port conflicts during startup
   - If a port conflict is detected, the application will display an error message with instructions for resolution

3. **Port Configuration in Docker**
   - The Docker configuration now includes port mapping that is compatible with Windows
   - The Docker Compose file has been updated to use the correct port mapping syntax for Windows

## Windows-Specific Considerations

### Windows Defender Firewall
Windows Defender Firewall may block the application from accessing the network. To resolve this:

1. When prompted by Windows Defender Firewall, allow the application to access the network
2. Alternatively, add the application to the Windows Defender Firewall exceptions list

### Port 80 Conflicts
Port 80 is commonly used by other services on Windows, such as IIS. To avoid conflicts:

1. The application now avoids using port 80 by default
2. If port 80 is required, the user must ensure that no other service is using it

### WSL2 Port Forwarding
When using Docker with WSL2 on Windows, port forwarding is handled differently. To ensure proper port forwarding:

1. The Docker configuration has been updated to use the correct port forwarding syntax for WSL2
2. The application now includes instructions for configuring port forwarding in WSL2

## Conclusion
The port configuration has been updated to ensure compatibility with Windows 11 and to avoid port conflicts. The application now supports dynamic port assignment, detects port conflicts, and includes Windows-specific considerations for port configuration.
