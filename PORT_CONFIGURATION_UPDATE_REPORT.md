# Port Configuration Update Report

## Overview

This report documents the changes made to the QT.AI Trading Bot Docker configuration to address port conflicts on Windows 11 systems. The frontend port has been changed from port 80 to port 3000 to avoid conflicts with system services that commonly use port 80 on Windows systems.

## Changes Made

1. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Updated `docker-compose.windows.yml` to map port 3000 to container port 80
   - Original: `- "80:80"`
   - Updated: `- "3000:80"`

2. **Build Script**
   - Updated `build_windows_docker.bat` to reference the new port
   - Changed frontend URL from `http://localhost` to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated all references to the frontend URL in documentation
   - Added troubleshooting information for port conflicts

4. **Docker Package**
   - Rebuilt `QT.AI_Windows_Docker.zip` with the updated configuration files

## Testing

The port configuration changes have been tested to ensure:

1. The Docker Compose file correctly maps port 3000 to container port 80
2. The build script correctly references port 3000 for the frontend
3. All documentation correctly references the new port
4. The Docker package contains the updated configuration files

## Compatibility

These changes ensure compatibility with Windows 11 systems where port 80 is commonly used by:

- IIS (Internet Information Services)
- Web servers
- System services
- Other applications

## Installation Instructions

The installation process remains the same, but users will now access the frontend at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Instead of:

```
http://localhost
```

The backend API remains accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Troubleshooting

If users still encounter port conflicts:

1. Check if port 3000 is in use:
   ```
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```

2. If port 3000 is in use, modify `docker-compose.windows.yml` to use a different port:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "3001:80"  # Or any other available port
   ```

3. Update the build script and documentation accordingly
